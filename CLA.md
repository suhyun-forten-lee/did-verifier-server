# Individual Software Grant and Contributor License Agreement
## Based on the Apache Software Foundation Software Grant and Individual Contributor License Agreement
### http://www.apache.org/licenses/

Thank you for your interest in the OpenDID project (the “Project”). In order to clarify the
intellectual property license granted with Contributions (defined below) from any person or
entity, the Project must have a Contributor License Agreement (“CLA”) on file that has been
signed by each Contributor, indicating agreement to the license terms below. This license is for
your protection as a Contributor as well as the protection of the Project and its users; it does
not change your rights to use your own Contributions for any other purpose.

You accept and agree to the following terms and conditions for Your present and future
Contributions submitted to the Project. In return, the Project shall not use Your Contributions in
a way that is contrary to the public benefit or inconsistent with its nonprofit status and bylaws
in effect at the time of the Contribution. Except for the license granted herein to the Project
and recipients of software distributed by the Project, You reserve all right, title, and interest in
and to Your Contributions.

**1.	Definitions.**
This document is a CLA (Contributor License Agreement) that must be signed by all Contributors to the Project.
**“You”** or **“Your”** shall mean the copyright owner or legal entity authorized by the copyright owner that is making this CLA with the Project. For legal entities, the entity making a Contribution and all other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common control with that entity are considered to be a single Contributor. For the purposes of this definition, “control” means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
**“Contribution”** shall mean the code, documentation or other original works of authorship expressly identified in Schedule A, as well as any original work of authorship, including any modifications or additions to an existing work, that is intentionally submitted by You to the Project for inclusion in, or documentation of, any of the products owned or managed by the Project (the **“Work”**). For the purposes of this definition, “submitted” means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to the Project or its representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the Project for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by You as “Not a Contribution.”

**2.	Grant of Copyright License.**
Subject to the terms and conditions of this CLA, You hereby grant to the Project and to recipients of software distributed by the Project a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute Your Contributions and such derivative works.
For the avoidance of doubt, by agreeing to this CLA, You confirm that the Project and recipients of software distributed by the Project are free to use the code, documentation, or other original works of authorship that You submit as part of Your Contributions.

**3.	Grant of Patent License.**
Subject to the terms and conditions of this CLA, You hereby grant to the Project and to recipients of software distributed by the Project a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by You that are necessarily infringed by Your Contribution(s) alone or by combination of Your Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted.
Should any entity initiate patent litigation against you or any other entity (imcluding through a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit), alleging that your Contribution or the Work to which you have contributed constitutes direct or contributory patent infrigement, any patent licenses granted to that entity for the Contribution or Work shall be terminated as of the date such litigation is filed. 

**4.	Representations with Respect to the License and Contributions.**
You represent that you are legally entitled to grant the above license. If your employer(s) has rights to intellectual property that you create that includes your Contributions, you represent that you have received permission to make Contributions on behalf of that employer, that your employer has waived such rights for your Contributions to the Project, or that your employer has executed a separate Corporate CLA with the Project.

**5.	Additional Representations with Respect to Contributions.**
You represent that each of Your Contributions is Your original creation (see section 7 for submissions on behalf of others). You represent that Your Contribution submissions include complete details of any third-party license or other restriction (including, but not limited to, related patents and trademarks) of which you are personally aware and which are associated with any part of Your Contributions.

**6.	Disclaimers.**
You have no additional obligations, such as making further code support, after making a Contribution, and any support for Your Contribution is at Your discretion.
You may provide support for free, for a fee, or not at all. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, You provide Your Contributions on an "AS IS" BASE, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
Also, You shall retain the rights to Your Contribution and may use it for other projects or purposes.

**7.	Non-Original Creations.**
Should You wish to submit work that is not Your original creation, You may submit it to the Project separately from any Contribution, identifying the complete details of its source and of any license or other restriction (including, but not limited to, related patents, trademarks, and license agreements) of which you are personally aware, and conspicuously marking the work as “Submitted on behalf of a third-party: [named here].”
Additionally, if submitting non-original works, You must cleary specify the original author's license and submit it as a separate file.
If You violate this obligation by submitting a third party's work without proper authorization, resulting in copyright infrigement, You shall be solely responsible for any legal liabilities arising from such infrigement.

**8.	Agreements.**
You agree to notify the Project of any facts or circumstances of which you become aware that would make these representations inaccurate in any respect.
